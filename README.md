## 00-PhylogeneticsProtocol_v1.0.pdf
This document serves as an a priori established protocol ([phylotocol](https://github.com/josephryan/phylotocol)) laying out our planned phylogenetic experiments to test whether the *Sycon ciliatum* and *Leucosolenia complicata* homeobox genes reported to be Cdx orthologs are truly *bona fide* orthologs of Cdx (or any other Hox/ParaHox gene). NOTE: ammendments to this protocol will be included as appendices in a new version of this document.
